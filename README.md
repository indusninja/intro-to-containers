# Intro to containers Workshop
This repository is a companion to a containers workshop that can be found [here](https://container.shader.works/).

## Exercise 1
The solution to the [first exercise](https://container.shader.works/exercise-1) in the workshop is given in `exercise-1.sh` script.

## Exercise 2
The solution to the [second exercise](https://container.shader.works/exercise-2) in the workshop is given in `exercise-2.sh` script.

## Exercise 3
The solution to the [third exercise](https://container.shader.works/exercise-3) in the workshop is given in `exercise-3.sh` script.

## Exercise 4
The solution to the [fourth exercise](https://container.shader.works/exercise-4) in the workshop is given in `./Dockerfile`. This `Dockerfile` can be build by:
```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile .
```

## Exercise 5
The solution to the [fifth exercise](https://container.shader.works/exercise-5) in the workshop is given in `exercise-2.sh` script.
```bash
docker build -f react-app/Dockerfile .
```

## Extra
The `wordpress` containers from [Exercise 3](#exercise-3) can be created more easily via Docker Compose by using the ./docker-compose.yml file. The containers defined in this file can be generated by:
```bash
docker-compose -f "docker-compose.yml" up -d
```
And to remove and destroy those containers:
```bash
docker-compose -f "docker-compose.yml" down
```
